      <h4>Why Mays?</h4>
      <p><strong>The Mays Constitution</strong>: We the followers of Mays, will
        always sell the best products with the greatest enthusiasm. All of our
        patrons' hair should be flown back by the power of our voices. We are no
        longer our former selves. We are a Billy Mays.
      </p>

    <div>
      <img src="assets/bill_m_copy.jpg" alt="how we Mays.">
      <h4>How We Mays?</h4>
      <p><strong>Mays All Days!!</strong>: To be a solid BM, you must live the
        part at all times. Throw out all clothes that are not a blue button-down
        or a pair of khakis (it was well known that Billy Mays never wore
        underwear). Stop shaving all the damn time. We must become BM.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="assets/buncha_bill_m.JPG" alt="Become a Mays.">
      <h4>Become a Mays!</h4>
      <p><strong>I'm Mays, Too!</strong>: Does the Mays lifestyle appeal to you?
        If so, you can get started immediately. Simply find a product - perhaps
        this fine flexbox - and a customer, and start selling your stuff in the
        BM uniform. Once you've begun, please send $1000/month to the BMTSC.
